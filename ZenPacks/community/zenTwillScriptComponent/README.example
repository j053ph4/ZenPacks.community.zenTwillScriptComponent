To create a ZenPack with a new custom component, perform the following:

1) Begin creating a ZenPack from the GUI in the usual fashion (as documented)
	a) be sure to set dependency on Zenpacks.community.ConstructionKit
	
2) From the command line:
	a) cd $ZENPACKHOME/ZENPACKS.NAME1.NAME2/ZENPACKS/NAME1/NAME2(replace with correct path to your Zenpack)
	b) rm -Rf *
	c) cp $ZENPACKHOME/ZenPacks.community.ConstructionKit/ZenPacks/community/ConstructionKit/example/* ./

3) Modify the "Definiton.py" file as needed to suit needed component attributes and data collection methods

4) Reinstall the ZenPack from the command line with:
	zenpack --link --install=$ZENPACKHOME/ZENPACKS.NAME1.NAME2
	zopectl restart ; zenhub restart
	
5) Manually copy any plugins/scripts you intend to distribute to:
	$ZENPACKHOME/ZENPACKS.NAME1.NAME2/ZENPACKS/NAME1/NAME2/libexec
	
6) Create any desired component-based RRD templates and add to the ZenPack
	
7) Zenpack can now be exported from Zenoss GUI and installed elsewhere (make sure the ConstructionKit dependency is met).
